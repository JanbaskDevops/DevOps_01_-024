Application and Infrastucture:
==============================

Application: I want one application for E-leraning portal[Janbask]

Infrastucture: Where I can run this application.

These 2 cyles are running parallely.

1) My requirement is applying DevOps cycle to Application.
2) Provisioning infrastucture on demand

Step1: We have created S3 Bucket in cloud.
Step2: Uploaded e-learning folder to cloud
Step3: Given access to resources
Step4: Accessing the URL

Now, My application is up and running https://cloudopsforme.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/E-learning+Portal+version2/index.html

Now we can have 2 situation:

1) Infrastucture management.
2) Application management.

Handshake:
=========
Suppose I want to integrate sonarcloud with my application
