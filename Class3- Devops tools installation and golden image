let say my application need Java, terraform and packer, and let say you need 5000 server for it.[I need to installation on 5000 times]

root@ip-172-31-40-243:~# java --version
openjdk 17.0.9 2023-10-17
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 17.0.9+9-Ubuntu-122.04)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 17.0.9+9-Ubuntu-122.04, mixed mode, sharing)
root@ip-172-31-40-243:~# terraform --version
Terraform v1.7.0
on linux_amd64
root@ip-172-31-40-243:~# packer --version

Go to server and stop it. and create image.
