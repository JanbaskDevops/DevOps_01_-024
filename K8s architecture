Today's topic: Pod, controller and service mesh

Pod:
===
Pod is group of container.
1) Init container
2) Main container
3) Side car container

My reqirement is I want to run container  with name myContainer with port 8080 on TCP

docker run -idt -p 8080:8080 --name MyContainer image_name

Above command work fine one time per host, and it will give port not free.

In kubernetes we have implemented multihost solution, and they have defined YAML formate for running the container.

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:1.14.2
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:1.14.2
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80

apiVersion
kind
metadata
spec

High cluster concideration:
===========================

    No more than 110 pods per node. [Max capacity= 550000]
    No more than 5,000 nodes[worker node].
    No more than 150,000 total pods.
    No more than 300,000 total containers.

Kubernetes cluster on cloud
============================

Replicaset- When we want identical containers
replication controller- same as replica set but 
job
cronjob
daemon set


Lets say 1 container can serve 100 users, and I want to server 10000 users then I need 100 identical containers

who is going to write these YAML file?
======================================
These days we have some tools available like Helm that will write these YAML for you

https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/ [Helm charts installation]

How to create helm chart
=========================
helm create chart_name


Service mesh
============
GUI based implmentation for managing K8s environment.


These days Developer are providing helm chart, so we just need to install/uninstall helm chart.
