Spring pet clinic- It's a place where people can rentout place for pet/plant on day basis, and expert will take care of them

Developer will develop the application, and share the steps for ruuning the application along with deocumentation.

Spring Petclinic is a Spring Boot application built using Maven or Gradle. You can build a jar file and run it from the command line (it should work just as well with Java 17 or newer):

git clone https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic.git
cd spring-petclinic
./mvnw package
java -jar target/*.jar



ubuntu $ git clone https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic.git

Operation team expectation from development team
================================================
Development team provides complete inside about application



Operation mindeset
==================
CMMI: Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) is a process level improvement training and appraisal program. Administered by the CMMI Institute, a subsidiary of ISACA, it was developed at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). It is required by many U.S. Government contracts, especially in software development.


Development  >  Test   >  Stage   > Preprod   > Production[ruuning application]


They are very stable, and they will follow process without fail.

What happen when developer and operation people are working togather-

1) lots of fights.
2) Blame culture.

10% Become developer
90% Operations
