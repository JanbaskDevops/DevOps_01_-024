IAAS:Generally we will create linux machine, and we would be installing the tools
SAAS: Company will provide their cloud version which is very popular in market this days

Jfrog artifactory:
==================
When new version will come or number of days[reporting purpose]

I want to have report of all my build by Every Monday 11 AM >> Number of Day[After Every 8 days]

Every software has some version associated with it.

software <MajorVersion>.<Minorversion>.<fixpack>

ubuntu $ docker --version
Docker version 24.0.5, build 24.0.5-0ubuntu1~20.04.1
ubuntu $ git --version
git version 2.25.1

WORA: Write once run anywhere


FROM ubuntu
CMD echo "Helloworld"

docker build -t image1 . <Karthick>
docker build -t image1 . <Umesh>
docker build -t image1 . <Abimbola>


to avoid this duplication one can push image to cerntal place, and another can use it. this central place is known as artifactory.
