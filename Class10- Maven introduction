Application development lifecycle
==================================

> When we are developing the application we need presentataion logic and business logic

> presentation logic: The logic which is not changing[Example: Photo on website]

> Business logic: I want create calculator[add, sub, mul and div]

> We need to follow some directory stucture where we can have our data organize.

> Codding, testing, scripting, deployment

> there are some standard tool that provides stucture for organizing file and folder.
example: maven

> Developer will write .java file

> being a support engineer, I need to compile the java file, package[adding business and presentaion logic] the java file.

> how to compile java file> javac programname.java

At the command prompt, type "cd" followed by the path your Java program is saved to, then press "Enter." Type "javac [filename] and press "Enter" to compile the program. Type "java [filename]" and press "Enter" to run the Java program after it is compiled.


in our case:
We need to have java installed, and we can run the below command-
cd spring-petclinic/tree/main/src/main/java/org/springframework/samples/petclinic
javac PetClinicRuntimeHints.java  > PetClinicRuntimeHints.class
javac PetClinicApplication.java   > PetClinicApplication.class

We need to package the application>
combining both the class file and adding presenation logic.


testing> their might be some steps and tools are giving for testing

maven
=====
Maven is a build tool by which we can perform multiple activities-


    validate: check if all information necessary for the build is available
    compile: compile the source code
    test-compile: compile the test source code
    test: run unit tests
    package: package compiled source code into the distributable format (jar, war, â€¦)
    integration-test: process and deploy the package if needed to run integration tests
    install: install the package to a local repository
    deploy: copy the package to the remote repository


mvn <goal>
