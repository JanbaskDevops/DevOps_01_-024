# Golden image with docker
==========================

1) for writing docker image we need to write a test file with name dockerfile where we would be writing the instruction.

2) syntax to create docker image is: docker build -t <image-name> dicrectory-of-dockerfile.

vi editor
=========
It is basically test editor
1) to open text editor vi file-name | vi dockerfile

it has 2 mode-
1) insert mode: i
2) saved mode


Rule for docker image
======================
1) Dockerfile alway start with FROM statement.
   FROM <os-name>

2) Whenever we want to display anything on terminal
   CMD echo "Message"

FROM ubuntu
CMD echo "welcome to ubuntu"

3) to create docker image we run command >>>> docker build -t image-name .

Experiment3: Create a dockerimage that uses ubuntu, and we install java in top of ubuntu
Rule5: To install any software we need to run the command
RUN <linux command>

FROM Ubuntu
RUN apt install openjdk-11-jre-headless 

Whenever we do any installation, and prompt ask for yes/no, so we need to provide -y in the dockerfile itself

RUN apt-get update >>> Please run this command prior to install any software
Reading state information...
E: Unable to locate package openjdk-11-jre-headless
The command '/bin/sh -c apt install openjdk-11-jre-headless' returned a non-zero code: 100

Do you want to continue? [Y/n] Abort.
The command '/bin/sh -c apt install openjdk-11-jre-headless' returned a non-zero code: 1
