Kubernetes and helm
===================

What is Docker?
Packing application and dependacies. Docker is a single host solution.

Docker compose, docker swarm[multi host solution], but these are not very popular. reason is thier competetors is google[Kubernetes].

For Google container is not a new team they are running container from last 2 decoade[Borg and Omega]

Docker handshaked with K8s and agreed that Imgae would be created by docker, and it would be running in K8s.


Kuberntetes architecture:
=========================
> https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/best-practices/cluster-large/

> In k8s we have concept of master and slave.

In master we have 4 components.
==============================
1) API Server: It's responsible for all the communication between client and server.
Example: client reachout to API server and say I need 7000 Node. > out of capacity 
                                               I need 3000 Node. > it will create 3000 Node.
                                               I need 5000 Node. > I will create new 2000

2) ETCD(Fact of cluster): It will have all the information about current configuration. and it will store as a part of key value pair.
      server_count: 3000

3) Controller: it like management components.

4) Schedular: it is responsible for creating/deleting the resource.

Kubernetes installation:
========================


In slave we have 3 components.
=============================

1) Kubelet: Agent for master and slave communication.

2) kubeProxy: Networking part of slave is known as kubeproxy.
     In servers in AWS > Under security
        1) Inbound rules
        2) Outbound rule

3) Container(Pod): Running instance from docker image

Client:
=======
SOmeone who need responce
