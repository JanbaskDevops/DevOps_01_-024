1) ChatGPT: it's a tool, simillar to google search where we would be getting accurate answer.
How to install and use the chat GPT

2) Introduction to Devops
=========================
Father of Devops:Patrick Dubois
DevOps is improvement.[in what sense-> Technology wise, cost optimisation and time to market]
Technologies are changing, and we need to adopt latest techonolgy to use the things in best way.

1) Withdrawal money from bank.
2) Suppose you want to travel from US to India-

100yrs back: Ship[4 Monts]
50yrs back:[ship, flight[very costly]], Bus/car
25yrs back:[flight[costly]]
Now:flight

I want to send message to you[you> US, I am in India]
100yrs back: Birds(shorter distance)
50yrs back:(Mobile phone, very costly 2$/minute)
25yrs back:(Mobile, 1$/Minute)
Now: Whatapp, Facebook(Instant chat, free of cost)

My requirement: I want to creating Voting application

Information gathering phase: we will ask question to client about requirement.

Elephant/tiger/snake- Can you please tell me how to draw snake

*** Things looks very simple, but they are not.

Developer: Developer is developing something which is never exist.



Plan  > codding > Build  > Test

1) Information gather phase
2) Feedback phase
3) Look and feel[Adding static logic]


Application development phase
=============================

Planing: What we want to develop, and how we want to develop

Codding: Developer will do codding as per my requirement

Building: we would be adding presentation logic application

Testing: test the application


Application support phase
=========================
Relase: Developying application in testing environment

Deploy: Deploying the application in production environment

Operate: Running Bike/Car[fill the fuel] > Maintanance activity

Monitor: Keep eye on it

When we are creating any application we will test it multiple times to make sure everything is working fine-

1) Development environment
2) test environemnt
3) stagging environment
4) pre-prodution environemnt
5) Production environment[Client facing environment]// my client can use the application


Plan code build test release deploy operate monitor

> For application development we have 8 phase.
> Everyphase is owned by expert
> If their is one person causing delay, it will impact entire application

Role of Devops: to make all the phase efficient.
