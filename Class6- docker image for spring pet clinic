Dockerizing spring pet clinic
=============================
1) Development team will do development activity, and they share step for deployment-

git clone https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic.git
cd spring-petclinic
./mvnw package
java -jar target/*.jar


Exacize: Create docker image for above instruction.

https://hub.docker.com/ >> You need to signup here. it's 2 step process.[Name and email id]
It's the store where we are storing the images.


Lab: https://labs.play-with-docker.com/


FROM ubuntu
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt install openjdk-17-jre-headless -y
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt install git -y
RUN git clone https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic.git
WORKDIR spring-petclinic
RUN ./mvnw package
CMD java -jar target/*.jar


ubuntu $ docker build -t image1 .
DEPRECATED: The legacy builder is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
            Install the buildx component to build images with BuildKit:
            https://docs.docker.com/go/buildx/

Sending build context to Docker daemon  26.11kB
Error response from daemon: dockerfile parse error on line 4: unknown instruction: git

Generally, in front of linux command we need to enter RUN/CMD, generally in last command we add CMD else RUN


WORKDIR: RUN cd

RUN: for provisining the base image.[It means if you want to add any additional software like git and java incase of ubuntu]
Docker work in the concept of WORA[write once run anywhere]

docker tag local-image:tagname new-repo:tagname
docker push new-repo:tagname

docker tag image2 2020ht66049/image2:8.2.2
docker push 2020ht66049/image2:8.2.2

step 1) Creating connection between dockerhub and linuc terminal

ubuntu $ docker login
Login with your Docker ID to push and pull images from Docker Hub. If you don't have a Docker ID, head over to https://hub.docker.com to create one.
Username: 2020ht66049
Password: 
WARNING! Your password will be stored unencrypted in /root/.docker/config.json.
Configure a credential helper to remove this warning. See
https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login/#credentials-store

Login Succeeded

Step2: Tag image with new name

docker tag local-image:tagname new-repo:tagname
docker push new-repo:tagname

docker tag image1 2020ht66049/image1:kaku

step3: run the image docker run -idt -p 8080:8080 2020ht66049/image1:kaku


Introduction to Docker
======================
> Docker package application and dependancy, so you just need to run the docker run command, in background it will do everything.

> Docker is WORA[write once use anywhere]

> Docker is using parallel processing

> Every linux command is creating a layer, and those layers are working parallely.

> size of docker image is dependant on size of layer. some layers contribute space to docker image

what is docker hub?
===================
It is a place where people are storing their images for future use.

URL: https://hub.docker.com/

Creating repository:

Trusted Content-

Docker Official Image

Verified Publisher

Sponsored OSS

> Docker uses layered communication, it means if anything is not their then only it will download else it will display already exist
29202e855b20: Already exists > it's from ubuntu command



Tomorrow Agend:
===============
1) Docker image instruction
2) running docker commands
3) docker cheat sheet

Homework:
=========
1) make you hand darty with docker hub, and explore atleast 5-10 softwares, and try to run it

docker pull jenkins
docker run -p 8000:8000 jenkins:2.60.3
