[SAST/DAST]: Static Application security testing/Dynamic Application Security Testing 


Static application security testing: 
====================================
It's basically testing application code from security point of view.

Horusec is an open source framework that enhances the identification of vulnerabilities in your project with just one command.

[Source code] https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop
Step1: git clone https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop

[SAST tool link] https://github.com/ZupIT/horusec
Step2: apt-get update ; apt install jq

Step3: curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZupIT/horusec/master/deployments/scripts/install.sh | bash -s latest # This will install the tool
   
Step4: horusec start -D -e="true" -p ./

Dynamic application security testing
=====================================
We perform dynamic application security testing in application URL.

1) Application URL: it will refer application [https://www.google.com/]
2) Application end point: it would refer landing zone.[https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ogbl#inbox]

Step1: docker run --rm -idt -p 3000:3000 bkimminich/juice-shop 

docker run -t ghcr.io/zaproxy/zaproxy:stable zap-baseline.py -t <Application URL>
docker run -t ghcr.io/zaproxy/zaproxy:stable zap-baseline.py -t http://ip172-18-0-13-cn6nruk7vdo000fv82qg-3000.direct.labs.play-with-docker.com/#/

Software composition analysis
=============================
Host > docker > Application >> One stack
in software composition analysis, it will break stack into components, and then do analysis

Step1: git clone https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop

Step2: cd juice-shop/frontend/ ; vi package.json
in package.jso we have defined our dependancy. 

Step3: add dependacy "lodash": "0.5.0",
lodash: Lodash is a JavaScript library which provides utility functions for common programming tasks using the functional programming paradigm

Step4: apt-get update ; apt install npm

Step5: npm install
