I am working on spring pet clinic application, my requirement is creating dockerimage for it.

WORA: write once run anywhere.

Main purpose of artifactory is avoiding duplication and making process faster.



git clone https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic.git
cd spring-petclinic
./mvnw package
[5-8 minutes]


java -jar target/*.jar


1) Application will alway have some tracking number[version]. which would be like
   <Majorrelease>.<minorRelease>.<fixpack>
    1.2.1
    1.2.2
    1.2.3
    ----

What is the repository?
It's a place where we will store the articat.


<distributionManagement>
    <snapshotRepository>
        <id>snapshots</id>
        <name>a0ndkiugmzwlt-artifactory-primary-0-snapshots</name>
        <url>https://umeshkumar.jfrog.io/artifactory/abimkartik-libs-snapshot</url>
    </snapshotRepository>
</distributionManagement>


docker push > docker login [username password]




docker pull umeshkumar.jfrog.io/xyz-docker/hello-world:latest

docker tag umeshkumar.jfrog.io/xyz-docker/hello-world umeshkumar.jfrog.io/xyz-docker/hello-world:1.0.0
docker push umeshkumar.jfrog.io/xyz-docker/hello-world:1.0.0

docker tag image1 umeshkumar.jfrog.io/xyz-docker/image1:1.0.0

docker push umeshkumar.jfrog.io/xyz-docker/image1:1.0.0
